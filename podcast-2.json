It could come while you're out with friends, running an important meeting, or just with your family at home. A spiraling thought that leaves you feeling helpless. That's why you have your self-care, your coping strategies. That's why you have us. I'm Nora McInerney, and this is the Head Start Embracing the Journey. A podcast where we'll be taking all those things you usually save for your friend group out into the open, so we can all find a bit of optimism. I'll definitely be sharing my experiences and vulnerabilities and trying to pick up some things along the way to work into my own routine, but this show isn't about me. It's about life. And wow, that just made it sound very deep. And I guess it will be deep, but it won't be heavy. For those battling chronic migraine, these conversations are going to be even more helpful and relatable. So definitely stick around. This show is brought to you in partnership with AbbVie. So first, let's hear some important safety information and stay tuned to the end of the podcast for more. Indication Botox. Ana botulinum toxin A is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used to prevent headaches in adults with chronic migraine who have 15 or more days each month with headache lasting four or more hours each day in people 18 years and older. It is not known whether Botox is safe and effective to prevent headaches in patients with migraine who have 14 or fewer headache days each month or episodic migraine. Important safety information. Botox may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Get medical help right away if you have any of these problems anytime, hours to weeks after injection of Botox. Problems swallowing, speaking or breathing due to weakening of associated muscles can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at the highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months. Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms, including loss of strength and all over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing and trouble swallowing. Please stay tuned for additional important safety information within this podcast. Hi everybody. Good to be back. Good to have you back. In a Pew Research Center study, 62% of parents said that parenting is harder than they expected. You can count me among that number. Parenting isn't just hard, of course. It is often a joy. It is often wonderful. It is hands down one of the most important jobs a person can do and a privilege to get to do it and to get to do it our way. Every generation has more parenting tools than the one that came before them. We're all just doing our best. And even if you are the calmest, most serene soul out there, there's always a moment where your kids are going to break you. They will. They will find a way somehow. Mine are always related to Pokemon cards or a request for a hot dog, a boiled hot dog after somebody had turned up their nose at the many, many dinner options that had been laid before them. The point is they're going to find a way to get to you. And they're not trying to, of course. And neither were we as children. They're just trying to get their needs met. But when there's a lot going on and there always is and the dog is barking and the emails are piling up and the phone is ringing and the plans are changing and the kids are then arguing, which makes the dog bark more, to parent gently when we are not at our best physically or mentally, it can feel impossible. Today's guest, Marina Medvedelantini, is the founder of the blog and online community Parenting with Migraine, where she creates and curates content to help other parents who are struggling to balance parenting, work, life, and chronic migraine. We are always learning. There is never a moment where you know it all. And if you think you do, just wait a minute. Your kids have more to teach you. I can't wait to talk with Marina Medvedelantini. But before we do, let's have a chat with my friend, our resident headache specialist, Dr. Ryde. I'm so glad to see you again. You too, Nora. I hope that you're having a wonderful day. Your hair is looking extra pink today. I know the listeners don't get to see it. I just got it done. Thank you. I'm so glad. My wife would be proud of me for noticing. I'm well trained. Thank you. Yes. How's it going? Good. I'm trying to also train my kids to notice things like that. And I came back from my appointment and my six-year-old said, I thought maybe you'd come back with normal hair. Thanks, sick burn. Kindergarten is brutal. Okay. I made a mistake. One time she had sort of highlighted her hair. I think she's gorgeous. I think her hair is gorgeous, however it is. And I didn't say anything about it. And this is a couple of years into our marriage. And at this point, we're working all the time. We're taking care of kids. We're being the parents that we're trying to be. And I just didn't say anything about it. And it broke her heart. Oh, I love to see a lesson come together. And today's topic has so many lessons within it because we are talking about the humbling journey of parenting. Yeah. We're not just talking about parenting. We're talking about parenting with chronic migraine, which if parenting is already a doozy, this is a doozy of a humdinger. Can you help me understand how migraine triggers may be exacerbated in environments where we are juggling work, family, so many competing priorities all at once? Yeah. I'm really blessed to have three kids and an amazing wife. And we're raising these kids together. And it's an awesome, rewarding journey, right? But it is humbling and painful and frustrating. And that's all without chronic migraine, playing a role in my experience with parenting to think about adding this debilitating disease when you're dealing with your kids or trying to parent them in a particular way or to try to learn from some of the parenting mistakes that maybe you experienced in the way that you were raised and not repeat them, but do that in the presence of migraine attacks would be really unbelievable if I hadn't seen through my practice, parents doing it every day. The biggest issue with parenting is you can't walk away from it. It's frowned upon. Yeah. Yeah. They've got laws. They've got laws. So where I can take a break from work, change careers or work towards that anyway, this is one of the things that you can't walk away from. I definitely don't want to characterize parenting as a trigger for chronic migraine. We certainly want to be really clear about that, not driving it, but it creates environments where triggers can exist. Yeah. Stress, poor sleep, poor nutrition. So it creates environments where you are more likely exposed to those triggers, but rather than being able to sort of pull your card and say, you know what, I'm going to go lay down and I'm going to maybe take some medication or I'm going to turn the lights down and turn the TV off. Unfortunately, we don't have the chance to do that in a parenting environment. And so that is the biggest sort of deal with parenting and chronic migraine is that you simply can't walk away from that environment that is so laden with triggers. Yeah. You know, Dr. Ryan, you know this, all parents need support, need support systems, need a village, need a plan, need routines. How do parents with chronic migraine develop those strategies so they can care for these children who need them and who they love? Yeah, I think this is a, you know, hope for the best plan for the worst kind of situation. Of course, I think any parent wants to wake up on a Saturday morning and you know, it's butterflies and rainbows and we're taking all the kiddos off to the park or to a great breakfast or to a fun trip somewhere, that kind of thing. And so that's what we hope for. And I think that there will be those days, but we plan for the worst. And that's where I think having that structure and those phone numbers to call and those, you know, messages to send out to family, friends, church communities, volunteer communities, even chronic migraine communities. I think that preparing if you're going to be anywhere where there are smells or sounds or lights or the springtime or the fall where for some people, weather triggers become a bigger issue for menstruating women who have their cycle at a particular time in the month and they know that they've got a field trip with one of the kiddos, then I'm going to bring that support system to make sure that should a migraine attack crop up in that environment, that we have support in place to make sure that we can achieve being as present as possible. And that's kind of the approach that I think that parents who are coping with migraine need to take where they're the one who may be projectile vomiting, unfortunately, and have a strategy in place to cope with that during whatever environment they might be in. That was such a powerful reframe. I think everybody needs that. I'll be right back after the break with Marina Medved Lentini. So stick around. What happens when the right people connect?

Welcome back to the Head Start, embracing the journey. Marina, hello. Welcome to the show. Hi, Nora. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. I have a question for you, just a little icebreaker for us. What is your proudest parenting moment from this week? Well, I had a sleep study with my daughter in Boston. She was crying and I was trying to be patient and my head was pounding. And so I was supposed to say something profound to get her to relax. And I said to her, if you don't stop crying, then this won't work. Then we're going to have to come back here and do this all over again. And she got scared and she stopped crying and we got through it. A sleep study just seems like one of those simple things that you have to do with your child, but because it's complicated by chronic migraine. Yeah. It's just, there's no simple thing, but we got through it. That's the moment we got through it. Just like we get through everything else. One day at a time, one step at a time, one moment at a time, we get through it. So I want to ask you how this all began because you are a mother, which is in my experience, the job that I am the least qualified to do. And yet the job where I don't get any breaks. I need some supervision or something. I'm somehow the boss. I don't know how that happened and you are a person living with chronic migraine. So you are doing all of the difficult things that I am doing with this added layer, this added sort of weight upon you. How did your chronic migraine journey began? I remember my first memory of having a migraine attack, which I didn't know that that's what it was, was when I was having a picnic with my family and friends in Ukraine. And when we came to the United States, that's when I was diagnosed with migraine. It was episodic migraine then. And after trying different treatments, I learned to live with it. I navigated successfully through college, law school, and career as an attorney. But once I got married and became pregnant, my hormone fluctuations significantly changed my migraine attack pattern. And even though some women actually get better during pregnancy, I wasn't that lucky. So my migraine attacks actually became worse in frequency and severity. My migraine progressed into chronic migraine. And it was long until I started experiencing daily migraine attacks. Daily while you have a baby that everybody wants to describe as a bundle of joy and they are, and they are also a bundle of needs. There's so much to do. How did you navigate motherhood with daily migraine attacks? You know, everything just seems challenging, right? And here I was doing it all through nausea, light sensitivity, vomiting. It was debilitating. I would wake up in the morning with some free time and then the migraine attack would start. And I would spend all day with these symptoms until bedtime. And that would repeat day after day for a very long time. By the time I was having daily migraine attacks, my daughter, she would be crying. And my son, he would be running around without pants and I would sometimes sit on the floor and just cry. My husband would come home, the babies are crying, the wife is crying. The toddler is crying. Everyone's crying. Everyone is crying. And my husband, he was so supportive and he was so helpful. And we got through it, but it was hard. It was so hard. I couldn't lay down in a quiet, dark room because I had to take care of the kids. The days were just all a blur. I leaned on my family who were also extremely supportive, but it was just very, very hard. And I felt hopeless. I felt alone despite the fact that I had a very supportive family because I felt like I was the only one that this was happening to. Tell me about the feeling of not just motherhood, which is often just very lonely in general, but doing that with chronic migraine and that feeling that you are alone, that loneliness of believing that it is only you who is having this experience. Right. I remember researching migraine online. And I remember finding out more about the disease and yet not finding people like me. Even though there were people around me, I felt like nobody could understand me. I would be talking to friends and sharing my experience and they would tell me, hang on, you're going to be okay. I didn't have anybody that I could talk to who could tell me, hey, I have a child too who just walked in on me throwing up in the bathroom because I was having a migraine attack and I felt nauseous because, hey, that happened to me. That type of loneliness you get from living through this difficult experience that you don't know that other people are going through it. I'm so glad you had a supportive family who was able to show up and physically be there for you. That's such a gift. But what you're also talking about is the kind of support that you can only get from a person who understands what you are going through. So tell me about starting parenting with migraine. Right. So what helped me in my own chronic migraine journey was finding support groups and learning more about migraine and educating myself about chronic migraine and learning how to advocate for myself. Finding different migraine treatments, including working with my doctor to receive Botox for chronic migraine. After going through this experience, I became passionate about raising migraine awareness, helping people feel less alone and educating others about chronic migraine. I wanted to start parenting with migraine on that community to show parents that living with chronic migraine is possible. And I stress the importance of finding a headache specialist to help people manage chronic migraine. What is the response been to people who have discovered parenting with migraine? Sometimes when I'm having a rough day, like I'm having a rough migraine attack and I would get a message where somebody tells me that I helped them to get on a path in their own migraine journey. And that makes everything so much more worth it for me. Can I ask you just logistically? I'm so interested in how people do all of the things that they do, especially in your situation. How do you balance parenting, parenting with migraine and having chronic migraine? A lot of people sometimes ask me, how do you do it all? And so my answer is I don't. I do the best I can. There are some days that I can't get anything done at all. And there's some days where I'm very productive. And so I try to not put too much pressure on myself about getting it all done. And that's something I always tell my community that as a person living with chronic migraine, holding yourself to the standards of a person without this disease is not something we should be doing because that's setting us up for a failure. As a family, we work together to do what mom can do. If there's something mom can do, we know that mom may probably do it the next day and we manage. How do you talk about chronic migraine with your kids? How did you explain it to them? At what ages and what did they and do they understand? That's such a good question. My kids have never known me without chronic migraine. And that's such a sad thought, but that's just my reality. And so we've always talked about it. I've always been honest with them. Age appropriate conversations, but honest conversations because I would rather tell my kids the truth in an age appropriate manner than having them imagine something, than having them kind of invent things in their heads, why mommy is on the couch half the month. So in the beginning when they're little, it's, well, mommy's head aches or mommy is not feeling well or mommy needs to be alone right now on the couch. And now that my kids are eight and seven, we have different conversations. Now it's mommy has migraine attacks. We use proper migraine language. What have you learned from other parents in the community? What are they struggling with parenting with chronic migraine? One of the things parents with migraine attacks struggle with is guilt and not feeling like they're doing enough. And it's just something that comes up often in the community. And I always remind people that loving our kids, taking care of our kids for any parent as a parent with this disease or not, that's the most important thing. And this is how I deal with the guilt. I try to do the best I can under the circumstances I'm given and I try not to feel guilty about it. Marina, how can friends, family members, coworkers, strangers, neighbors, how can people help the people in their lives who are living with chronic migraine? What are some of those simple, practical things that we can do to help? One the most important thing is to believe people with chronic migraine. There's so much stigma attached to migraine. It's a neurological, often debilitating disease. And yet the stigma attached to it is that it's just like a headache that people with migraine are often lying and that they're just having a headache. Or taking migraine attacks seriously, supporting people, supporting your loved one with migraine, offering to help or just a phone call where, or I guess nobody talks on the phone anymore. I do. I love a phone call. Call me. And just to talk on the phone or through a text about how are you feeling right now? I would love to hear you tell our listeners about your approach to managing your chronic migraine and making the most of your time with your children. During my migraine journey, I found that I can basically do anything with my kids and I can make memories with them. It can be either laying on the couch and watching a movie or it can be going on a trip. But whatever it is that we do, the most important thing is that I am there for them. I am near them. And I take lots of pictures so that they remember it and that I remember it. I love that so much. Thank you. Kids are so resilient. They're such amazing little human beings and they just love you. Kids love their parents and they want to spend time with them. This year, I've been really trying to focus on the things that I can do. Whatever little that they are. The other last weekend, we went to the butterfly garden and we looked at little butterflies flying all over us and my kids loved it. They just absolutely loved it. It was such a great little trip and such a great memory. And so just doing little things like that. Marina, you're so wonderful. You're so delightful. We always like to end our show by asking our guests to share a message for people who are living with chronic migraine. We don't call it advice, but is there a message you would like to leave our listeners with, especially, I think, parents with chronic migraine? I hope they see that you can be a parent and have a migraine attack. And yes, it is hard. It can be challenging at times. At times I'm just frustrated and most of the time it's a beautiful, beautiful experience being a parent. And yes, chronic migraine gets in the way, but it does not take away from being a parent. And so I hope that my parenting with migraine community can help people see that. Thanks for listening to the Head Start, Embracing the Journey.
