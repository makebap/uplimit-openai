My name is Dan Roanets and I'm here for the Monday show as we take a deeper look into all things Aston Villa. Joining me today is John Townley, back from the game yesterday. Your first home game to report on John for the first time as the main man. Matt Kendricks back once again. Two podcasts in two days. Some work ethic this is Matt. I'm gonna need to lie down I think. John how are you? How's things? Yeah good thank you. Back to winning ways now and the season's properly started hasn't it? So yeah I'm doing well thank you. Yeah it's nice to get three points on the board and goal difference back to zero as well which is a bit of a bonus. Obviously me and Matt did the post-match show yesterday so we've spoken about the game and had a kind of general feeling yesterday. John I'll come to you just quickly. Give me your kind of overall thoughts on what you saw yesterday. I do think that's probably one of the easiest games we'll play all season because that Everton team who were playing I thought below their own standards and their standards aren't very high. Like you look at Ashley Young who was so reliable for us last season and then he's making mistakes for Everton yesterday obviously throwing the ball to John Durand and things like that so it was a cruise really wasn't it? I don't think we're playing an easier game but you can only be what's in front of you and we needed that to be honest. I think it was a perfect fixture to have after Newcastle so as I say hopefully we can you know kind of kick on from here and this can be the start of the season and last week was you know something that we can all just forget. The benefit of us doing almost two shows now for every game is that the things that Matt, you and I didn't even talk about last night that people in the comments from last night's video were saying mention this mention that so we didn't talk about Fledgene to Hull which seems like it could be a go so we'll discuss that later as well. Also how good Villa Park is now in terms of our record there. Eight games won in a row at Villa Park which is something new probably to you and me John as the younger generation to feel like you go to Villa Park and that we're gonna win every single week. Obviously that dates back into last season as well. Only two goals conceded, none from open play in eight games which is unbelievable really. How good is this record at Villa Park Matt compared to some of the kind of performances of the 90s I guess? No you know why I'm back. Old man inside. It's funny I reckon I've said this before the podcast but before I used to go to home games when I was a teenager I used to live with my mom and dad obviously I used to say to me mom go on mom give us a prediction for today how do you think we're gonna get on and she was brilliant I mean I don't know why we've not got doing the lottery numbers you'd always nail it you know within a goal or two you know three one today or two nil or whatever but she'd always predict a win because Aston Villa we'd always turn up to Villa Park expecting to win and I think we've got we've definitely got that back in our DNA and I think this and we were a long way from being the kind of Manchester City you win trophies procession every every single year but I think you've got that feeling at Villa Park yesterday that oh we don't need to get excited for the last kind of nine minutes of injury time because this is what we do we're at Villa Park and we win and it's it's a nice feeling because given what's gone before in the last kind of 10 or 15 years it's a lovely feeling to have I mean it's a bit of a bit of a kind of cliche thinking when you when you call it a fortress and I always think of a fortress as being this horrible kind of really intimidating place and I think miss chiefing me wants it to be like that when we have games that are those ones on a knife edge when we're playing teams a lot better than Everton let's face it most of the visitors to Villa Park this season even that the next ones from from the SPL will probably be give us more of a game than Everton did but I just love it I just love the idea of expecting to win it's how we cope and we don't win I suppose that's the that's the next challenge yeah and I think you may spoken in the summer John about how important that home form could be in terms of having a good season that we spoke a lot about how and kind of neutrals will assess that our Chelsea will be better spurs will be better just on it automatically because they've spent money kind of discounting Villa and bright into they'll definitely drop off because of European football we just said just focus on yourself as long as you're winning games yourself and you only bothered about what you do and you just keep kind of churning out results churning out results is probably the wrong turn of phrase but kind of if you just keep going to Villa Park going oh we'll win and that's that if you can win 14 15 home games in the league and you're obviously gonna pick up points on the road as well that's a 60 point season is it as a pretty much as a minimum and if you're gonna go far into Europe if you get a home type Villa Park in a cup competition I'd expect us to be anyone now yeah precisely I would say that later on in the season again if we do go far in the Conference League I'm just not sure how we will be able to cope because yes our squad is seemingly bigger and better though we have just lost two key players for maybe the whole season we just don't know how that's gonna affect us and yes we have the Villa Park backing and things like that so I do agree with you Dan but let's just see how it plays out and I would also say that the away form that it needs to be pretty much equaling home form if we can we saw last season that Villa had spells where they were good at home and then poor away then good away then poor at home and Emery said after his press conference you know we started 5-1 with a 5-1 defeat sorry at Newcastle and then beat Everton 4-0 so already there's a huge there's a huge imbalance there so Burnley away then Liverpool away the next two Premier League games he's gonna want Elise to win one of those games and obviously Liverpool away will be a tough game but yes the home form needs to be good and I don't doubt it will be but over the course of a season you need to be getting your away results as well don't you so I think for Emery is he's not focusing on either if that makes sense we know that we need to be picking up you know the points that we picked up last season yes we gave everyone a 13 game head start but we've proven that we can compete with everyone and we'll be the team that's collected the most points apart from Man City since the start of the turn of the year we need to continue in that in that manner form. Do you remember Matt when we spoke probably a couple of years ago on the podcast now about Dean Smith's time at the club and it was talk of there was training ground players and and they maybe didn't translate into the match day this is a conversation sparked off the YouTube comments from last night's show so I know that we've already spoken a little bit about Leon Bailey there were some suggestions that is he a home player is he a player that can only do it at Villa Park now all of his goals have come at Villa Park I think he's six goals is it a problem that you've got a player who is pretty good at home but seems to go missing in away matches you took my me wondering back in my memory now I remember back in the day Tom Tom Fox I think was the only time I ever spoke to Tom Fox and he phoned me out the blue and talking about training ground players he said oh Matt you should see how Villa obviously dipping towards relegation that season or he said I should say well we train it's like a golfer on the on the driving range you could hit it as smoothly as possible but you get him on the grid and he game goes goes to pieces sorry so it's just popped into my head about kind of training ground players I don't think such a species should exist to be honest I think if you've got the the mental strength and capacity to be a professional footballer and a professional footballer one of the most competitive leagues in the in the world I don't think it should make much of a much of a difference whether you're playing from your home fans versus whether you're playing playing you know on the road basically I think it's just coincidence as much as we love ourselves as a fan base I think we're this the most supportive fan base in the world you know I'm sure our away fans give give our players lots of love and try and try and make them feel as comfortable as possible on that as well I asked them after the game about about Bailey specifically also that link that he had with DRB which we might touch on later on and I know this isn't the question but he said straight away that oh yes DRB and Bailey worked well today but against Newcastle didn't work at all so and he also he didn't hang Bailey out to dry but he also said that he played bad against Newcastle so he's not I think with Bailey I think Emery knows that there's a player in there because he trusts him because he just played him a lot and last season he played him a lot as well even when he was out of form just trying to give him a bit of a kick of the backside as well sometimes by saying things like oh he played bad against Newcastle but today played very well and he did his role perfectly so it's all about finding consistency with Bailey whether that's it's a thing about playing away from home or playing at home I'm not sure there's probably something in that because Villa are naturally gonna be controlling games more and therefore Bailey's getting more of the ball and things like that but I thought yesterday he contributed well defensively too I think he trapped back quite well because you obviously had Matty Cash playing almost as like the centre back in a back three at points so Bailey had to go the other way too so I thought he's probably actually one of Bailey's best games in a long time maybe he gets momentum now and play alongside Diaby more often and continue to impress that's what we all hope anyway. Was there any further clarity from Emery or since last night about his injury? Yeah I asked him about that and he mentioned the doctor said that it was no he mentioned nothing about an injury per se I think it was more maybe just an impact injury and he should hopefully be okay for Hibernian and the games coming up but he, a lot on Coutinho, he mentioned that the doctor did come in and mention about his injury but not about Bailey so therefore he doesn't think it's like a problem that will concern him. Bailey played on the right against Newcastle where Emery said that he had a bad game he plays very well yesterday to be fair to him and certainly contributes and you know we talk a lot about pre-game about who's gonna play and our comments on the Friday show we did were get rid of Bailey's no it shouldn't be no any other team has had enough chances and now everyone's going oh Bailey played pretty well on Sunday fair play to him which is the nature of football where do you get the best out of him where can you have a consistent run of Leon Bailey do you think? I think it's gonna be in that position that he played yesterday because he's with Diaby he knows him well he's obviously a combination that could potentially blossom there and he's not gonna be picking up that position that Diaby's playing in because that's that's the Arby's he's one of our best players and he's playing in a key role next to Ollie Watkins and yes Bailey played there last season but I didn't think he quite you know took that position as his own I think where we played yesterday just off the right kind of as a winger but more advanced that there's you know there's some responsibility for him to to track back and you know and get involved offensively but can hold his width he can get involved in different situations in the final third without having pressure I suppose of him scoring goals and making things happen he's more kind of just linking playing things like I think that's probably his best role because I think if you're asking him to you know be the match winner and playing that role that Diaby is because Diaby is simply a better player than him I think you're asking too much from them so Matt we spoke about John McGuinness on the podcast and how good it was to see him back in form since last night I've seen some stats of his obviously one goal 80% passing accuracy 47 touches two successful dribbles two passes into the final third five recoveries two clearances five ground duels won we've spoken a lot about John McGuin over the last 12 months or so and his kind of resurgence back into the side since the calamity under Steven Gerrard such a waste of a player playing him at holding midfield and covering the full backs all those kind of things for a long time he was asked to do that John McGuinness kind of blossomed into now he's got this kind of best position that almost like a number 10 I guess I suppose you'd describe it as I don't know whether you saw the the match of the day to analysis of him linking up with Diaby that's where his best position is isn't it and he joked after the game he's matched his goal tie from last season but that's what you want from McGuin if you're talking about getting to 60 odd points in the Premier League you need players to chip in with goals without the side and John McGuinness capable of getting six seven eight Premier League goals a season so John McGuin plays well Villa play well and I think yesterday he was he was my pick for man of the match and he he sets the tone in a game after when we're talking about Tommy's the captain and who offers that leadership I don't think John McGuin just what a straight spot for me in terms of organization and personality to keep things ticking but he leads by example doesn't he if he plays well the rest of the side kind of go okay we've

not available in all states or situations yeah it's never been a desire issue as it from beginning even when he was was playing poorly you know you could never accuse him of going hiding and got a little bit of sympathy for for it I thought I'd say this foot for Gerard foot for playing in there because I think he's I think he's an all-round midfielder who has got the attributes and qualities that you could play him in in various roles but thing that I love her love about McGinn is I think sometimes because of his sheer I don't know he's like a Duracell bunny and his energy and he's and he's in his graft and his mobility I think we forget what a gifted footballer he is he can see a pass okay he's only scored there's got two goals in the last last two seasons but we back him to really kind of up the ante with that so he can strike a ball he can he can see a pass he can make a tackle he can cover ground he does lead by example it's it's strange that we saying all this about him and I'm not saying I was one of the who wrote him off but we're all very very disappointed with him perhaps a year ago was it his fifth year anniversary or something recently yeah so I'm going to I team I feel very lucky that we've got him to be honest I think he has grown I think he's grown grown as a character and grown grown as footballer we've got a good tradition of Scottish players in that villa team you know we you know we've joked in the past haven't we about kind of preps John Durant playing like a competition winner or playing playing like like we'd play I think John McGinn every single time he turns up still plays with the almost the excitement and the intensity that we'd love to be able to pretend we could play at was it just a real real lovely everyman quality about him the hope I don't know he's one of those ones where maybe Unai Emery will will choose to rest him potentially back against tibs I hope he gets to play against him because I think it will just be a lovely kind of homecoming for him you know I assume he'll get a nice reception rather than the one Andy Vyman got a few years ago when he went back to Rapid Vienna and picked up three coins at him as he was stretched it off and stuff without I'm sure there'll be a lot of warmth through I don't know just a real kind of got a lot of likeability about him hasn't it we'll speak about the John McGinn derby towards the end of the show there's a quote from Major Constable in the Athletic I think he said when we see John McGinn pressing and working hard it gives us all a little boost to have him on our team is a privilege and it's nice that the players feel the same way as that we do a support it's hard to follow Matt's really good analysis there yes I agree with all those things really good analysis well welcome back to the show how can you follow that he sets the tone and in our preseason preview I said that he's probably gonna be our player this season because in every game that Villa win he's probably gonna be at least an 8 out of 10 okay like he's never gonna dip below those standards is he so yeah the way that he's progressed as a footballer I think there was quite a few players in our squad that needed a manager like you and I am at this stage of their career because they're getting you know towards this sort of peak years I suppose you'd say then he's one that's gonna continue to improve still I think he's I've always said he's impossible to stop when he gets going when he picks a ball on the halfway line or in that position when he gets going with it how do you stop him without fouling him I think it's impossible and I always remember Matteo Covacic of well of Man City now we said these the hardest midfielder to play against all that he's played against and that's quite something because he's played in every game trabasing finals welcome you know semi-finals final so it's a privilege to watch him as well he's such a unique player he's not one of those players that you can kind of just you know how would you replace John McInn put it that way that's another way of saying it he's so unique in the way that he goes by his business and the character that he is as well in the dressing room as Matt says he's a he's the Villa captain and I think that goes a long way as well he's he's moulded himself into that position too he I remember he did an interview a couple years ago when he was in the Scotland team and he was the vice captain playing and someone he said I'm taking on a new leadership role now and he seems to have taken that with with two hands now so yeah long may that continue yeah if I was Christian Prasla I'd be saying you can only replace John McInn with two or three players with what he offers I think he's like Matt said about him being kind of technically good footballer and you don't quite appreciate that because you just go he's a big bundle of energy puts his backside into players and that's kind of doing him a disservice I think his passing round I think it goes under the under the radars well you can ping a pass from anywhere really as a captain you want somebody who can speak honestly and speak articulately and this is probably one of the off-topic here but was some of his holiday photos as well on Instagram in the summer when he's on safari and doing a little dance with some of the natives and stuff like that just imagine he's the kind of guy who you'd like you know you'd like to spend time with you know his enthusiasm in these kind of lust for life I suppose just would seem to be infectious I think yeah and something that you spoke about in his post-match into another another weapon that he's hopefully adding to his arsenal is penalty taking he spoke about that in training him and Louise were the ones that have been kind of working on penalties he said that Watkins had missed one in preseason the M we'd got Louise and McGinn practicing penalties since and they I don't know how they decided on the pitch I did watch some of the highlights back I wanted to watch the full game over that time and as soon as the penalty is given which was in the stadium by the way we didn't speak about last night I didn't even know what was going on it was given from where I was across the line because we're all exactly what we're gonna touch on the ball so it looked like the referee done this rather than point to the spot and then everyone was like gathered round is that about to take a parent is that but it lowers people where I was sitting so what the hell's going on just as a slight point of order John it's been a while since I've been in that Villa Park press press box do you get you get the pictures I presume you get you get the replays do you get any kind of audio any commentary over the top of it or do you have to make your own mind up from it no no audio you get monitors like on every other seat which are quite small and they show replay once or twice maybe but I was with you from because where the press box is it's more towards the north stand so you and it's quite low down so you can't quite see the view of what's going on I thought it was either a foul and offside or something but to find referee took a couple of seconds granted but I think that's how it should be done he sort of weighed up his decision didn't in go with his spot kicking his right to see obviously on Anna clattered the wolf bar in the way and you're looking you had some fans off the games and oh how's that penalty if this one isn't well it's like well it's quite simple on Anna's that was a clear penalty that's me exactly bond that John McGinn penalty as well I know he didn't take it but I would back him to score a penalty because it just leather it wouldn't it like how could just like the right in which the ball would so the speed in which the ball would you know move towards go either the keeper could have reacted enough time anyway so yeah Louise really penalty John McGinn I think could take a pen Watkins is missed a few now as they so um yeah hopefully no penalty shootouts against him I don't know how that he started he was gonna take that penalty by the way what I was gonna say is and there only the bit I saw on the highlight as soon as apparently was given McGinn turned his head and look for the loose ways so I don't know about a conversation between them and said you know who fancies it whether Louise is the better of the two but he feels like a penalty taker to me Louise having seen him take one but the personality has he cast that kind of kind of almost arrogance I guess or the calmness to go yeah that we like yeah he's kind of relaxed enough to to step up very good penalty as well again probably under appreciating on yesterday's show and I don't see any once to watch it back a couple of times since so many isn't it no one saves that what you um what do you reckon John McGinn and Douglas Louise talk about away you wouldn't see them as kind of best buds would you know a bit like when they say if a lion could speak English we still want to understand them because their friends are references so far apart but Louise and McGinn come from so much different worlds that they can speak the same language but they know they can't understand each other probably best buddies actually they probably probably get on fire missing I just just see them as a very contrasting figures let's go away from the Everton game a little bit we've spoken about now for last night and 25 minutes of this so far or 20 minutes so quite full of gene a little bit John if you can give us a little bit more clarity on that this was something that was on social media last night pretty much right after the game but we didn't speak about it yesterday show at all a surprising one I think a little bit given it seems like it'll be a permanent move I don't know if it's similar to the Aaron Ramsey one which hasn't gone through yet and the room with Cameron Archer ones that there'll be a buyback clause for Phyllid Jean as well you would assume that would probably be the case yeah just give us a bit of a bit more clarity if you can and then we'll give our thoughts on it yes so firstly on the sort of buyback permanent loan situation the key thing is and I keep saying it that Villa want control over their younger players whether they leave or they go out on loan so for FFP reasons Villa selling Aaron Ramsey for 14 million potentially selling Phyllid Jean for about 5 million and Cameron Archer for potentially anything upwards of 20 million that's gonna help Phyllid Jean well that's that all of that contributes to but the problem is championship clubs championship club sorry they have no they have very little money here that's why Cameron Archer probably won't be going anywhere in the championship because gone are the days that could spend 20 we spent so much money in the championship when you but clubs can't do that anymore because of finances but yeah Villa want control so if Phyllid Jean goes to Hull plays well for two years you know we can then get him back for obviously an inflated fee but in the meantime it would help our our FFP situation and same as Aaron Ramsey if Aaron Ramsey has a couple of good years at Burnley Villa can buy him back integrate him into the squad or sell him on for a profit still so and these players are so young Aaron Ramsey a player that's played a couple of seasons in the championship now but for the money Villa will be getting for him a player who hasn't made a Premier League appearance yeah that's really good money and I'm Phyllid Jean I was surprised that there was I don't know quite to put this he played very well in preseason but before the preseason there was no doubt that he was one that obviously the club were happy to let go yes he's played well in preseason and he's proved himself that he can you know contribute in the team but that was when Leon Bailey was Leon Bailey missed most of the USA tour obviously came back for the Brentford game Villa was gonna recruit more players so I just always thought his minutes were always going to be lower and I'm not sure if he needs that in his development right now he needs to be playing games like he was last season and he clearly developed well because the difference between him from last summer to this summer was huge so maybe that'll be the case you know next year in the year after that he needs that at this point of his career I think so if he does depart then I think that could be a positive for both parties put it that way you can really get some money in for the FFP which is much needed and Phyllid Jean can you know continue to play first team games and he obviously wants more minutes at this point so yeah I don't think you can stop him doing that especially when you know how many games he's gonna play for the next season in the Premier League potentially some in the Conference League as well who knows but if you want to be playing games like the rest of the youngsters I think you've got to let them do that we speak about Cameron Archer is like a low-end Premier League move or a high-end championship move and Ramsey going to Burnley who most people tip to have a pretty decent season under company don't know disrespect to Hall but I'm gonna disrespect him because that's what everyone says Phyllid Jean to Hall for five million is a much lesser move than the others like if everyone's saying Phyllid Jean could be starting for Villa get rid of Bailey Phyllid Jean promote one of your own that level plan doesn't go to Hall does it for five million I'm fat I know we mentioned it yesterday I'm fascinated with the idea of buyback clauses I am I just find it it's been a while but I'll give you a crap analogy I find it a bit like if you buy somebody a gift but you think well I'll actually use that myself you know I mean so you let you to be off-benefit but you've already already keeping on I mean as an example I'll put my wife Spotify vouchers and some Bluetooth speakers that's Christmas a longer you know with a few other things as a stocking filler but it was bought with intention she'll forget and I could I can use and I think I think it's the same kind of someone's hedging your bets isn't it really which I think we said yesterday quite a shrewd quite shrewd move to to make the individuals involved and particularly Phyllid Jean my concern and this is probably a question for John as much as a response from me is some of these players that we've spoken about so less so less so Aaron Ramsey but Cameron Archer and Phyllid Jean they have been involved over preseason and we've thought well actually it's a good time to kind of bed them in a little bit more we're gonna have more games you know how many games could potentially have 50 games this season potentially think things go our well and I'm being very optimistic there what's every stinking now now we've got when dear we've got means we've got catenio where where does this extra support come from because if they're the peak of our youth team graduates and we're prepared to let them go or be with one eye further down the future where do we both drive bench from John is there gonna be a light flurry in the next ten days that's I know I haven't answered specifically about the one example but that's that's where I show a little bit of concern really Walmart plus members save on meeting up with friends save on having them over for dinner with free delivery with no hidden fees or markups that's

central plan only separate registration required see Walmart plus terms and conditions I think that's why Cameron archer probably hasn't left yet because Villa haven't got the forward in that they'd like to buy emery said back in January that as soon as Danny Inglis he was like well we want another experience number nine we want to add a striker to compete with Ollie Watkins and obviously Villa have to run but every wants to place per position if Villa after sell Cameron archer that there has to be a replacement that's that's gonna be lined up and yes his interest from Sheffield United particularly but it's a difficult deal to do because the Villa will want big money for those players because that's a player that's in England and the 21 international scores goals in the championship if Villa were looking to buy that player that's the money you'd expect to be paying maybe emery just doesn't think he fits right now or he's not ready something like that and he wants to bring someone else in that's more you know experienced and has maybe experience of European football we're saying that with the players is recruited so far the RB Telemans and Torres and Zaniolo now obviously they have an interest in a Cunha all those players are ready to win some ink for Villa whether he feels Cameron archer Aaron Ramsey Jaden Filiagina ready to contribute that's up to him and if that is the case and they will all leave then yeah you could expect as you say late Flourie how many days do we have left of the window now what nine days there's enough time there to complete business and you'd expect to have the targets lined up I don't see a way in which Cameron archer departs without someone coming in we can't play Ollie Watkins every game and we also can't rely on John Durant to be playing in the most of our room obviously games either so with exits surely more arrivals will come in you know he's kind of a little bit of an in-between I suppose in that you see a ready-made top six player which is what we want Aston Villa to be or is he a mid-range mid-ranging championship player he's probably somewhere in between but until he's fully established himself week in week out for a couple of seasons at that lower level he's not gonna be ready to me how old is he 21 21 we probably you know he's not a kid kid anymore he probably does doesn't need to be going out playing and if Villa can't guarantee lots of football which let's face it I don't think we can unless somebody higher up a lower end Premier League club comes or a recently relegated Premier League club comes in for him it's one of those where we probably invest in a little bit more in him in terms of our expectations based on a run of games in preseason and it's one of those where we're probably gonna have to bow bow to the manager who sees him week in week out and knows what he intends from this squad yeah I think it's the same argument for Cameron Archer as well he's 21 and he needs to be playing in the Premier League now and regularly so him playing the championship next season with Leeds Leicester those teams on loan if he scores 20 goals I think that proves basically nothing he needs to be playing in the Premier League because at the moment we look at him and thinking oh we could score goals in the championship but can they cut it against the Premier League defenders because there's so many good teams in the Premier League right now there's probably it's very difficult to say but I just think those players they need to be taken that's why I'm Ramsey I think if he goes to Burnley which should be completed soon it's been going on for a while now that's a brilliant move and if Phyllid Gane can get that right sorry Phyllid Gane I thought needed that as Matt said but if he's going to the championship again you're thinking will will he have a future at Villa because him playing well for Hull does that then mean he comes into the Villa squad and competes I'm not sure so yeah yeah for Phyllid Gane to go to Hull if that's the case and there is a buyback clause and Villa want to get him back and Villa go on to have a season this year where they're in Europe again for next year the only way Phyllid Gane gets back into the Villa squad is if he's the championship player of the year or something he's that good for Hull he's as a season where he scores six or seven goals for Hull coming back anyone I'll make a prediction for Archer I think Southampton might go for him I know you're saying they're drawn about a loan to a top-end championship clubs are relevant but I think if he goes to somewhere like Southampton permanently and they're banking on being promoted straight away he then gets his Premier League season next year and we get to look at him in two divisions because they've got money to spend on them and they've what mate 80 million hold on their midfield they've made money and obviously they're gonna sell Chalmers now for 15 to Everton but I just don't know how much money they can actually spend it's all in good bringing in money but is that gonna that might balance the books because they have no you know Premier League money now so we'll see but I agree I think Southampton would be a good move for him I know I've just said about it needs to be planning the Premier League but if you can have that at Southampton next year then I think that's okay but equally if you go Sheffield United he probably gets relegated this season it's difficult but whatever happens he has to be playing the Premier League as simple as that let's talk about the the Conference League then a little bit of a preview for the Hibs game now John I'll come to you for this because me and Matt spoke about last night the three subs that came off which is unusual for Villa to bring off Watkins and Louise in particular I play every minute don't know if they're available the third one I forgot last night was Diaby of course Coutinho, Carlos and Tielemans came on got there in the end we spoke about whether that was like are those main players in Diaby Watkins and Louise being taken off because they're starting Wednesday and Villa are going full strength first leg beat Hibs comfortably and kind of get ahead in the tie or are Coutinho unfortunately he's now injured but Carlos and Tielemans is Emery giving him giving them 25 30 minutes to go right get yourself up to speed because you're playing on Wednesday I think you probably would have done that without even if we weren't playing Hibberning to be honest because actually we were cruising in the game it's the second game of the season those players do need minutes to get into the rhythm as you say because it's difficult for Tielemans when's he gonna start Premier League games when you have Louise and Kamara I'm not sure same with Carlos I guess it's a bit easy for Carlos because we can play that back three at times but I'm not sure if it's linked specifically to that or because of the players that came off then they'll play against him so I'm not sure I actually expect Villa to field a pretty strong 11 and especially in the way leg if you can get let's say a 2-0 lead then the home leg you can then make changes but I think you need to just get try and get the job done as quick as you can don't mess about you know and underestimate Hibberning because Easter Road will be rocking and it's a scalp for Villa and every team they play in the Conference League Villa are the Cup final I suppose for a lot of teams even though it's only the playoff round but Villa are one of the favourites already you look at the teams that are in there Fuentina, Frankfurt and Lille I think they're the main one Osasuna as well those are the kind of the big five leagues Aston Villa are by far and away better than all of those teams Antwerp Frankfurt are about to lose their striker Kolo Mawani I think to PSG so that weakens them but yeah on Hibbs they'll be doing everything they can to try and keep Villa at home I think if we just play a strong team get the job done they can come back to Villa Park and then we can rest players for that Liverpool game I think the Hibbs game on Wednesday will be more difficult than Everton that game has got more riding on it it's that their place first like Everton were one of the biggest games of the season yeah precisely Matt would you agree with that would you be going strong on Wednesday or do you think it's a chance for someone like Duran to be starting games and maybe feeding off the confidence of his goal on Sunday we've got to get through the qualifiers haven't we you just go and get it won it's it's early in the season people you know I know they're gonna be playing what did we say 120 minutes most weeks by the time the fourth officials put that extra time added time up board but just you've got to get into the competition proper we've made such a big song and dance about a villa been back in Europe but I've been stung a couple of times because the last time we're in Europe I thought like John I was going on an exciting trip around the continent of various outposts I got to wrap it Vienna twice in two successful years a lovely lovely city how it that it was we lost we lost in the in the the qualifiers so you know I would go strong I'd go strong on Wednesday try and make sure that we've got some advantage some lead going into the second game at Villa Park because we've said at Villa Park we back us to roll over everybody and back us to roll over him but Villa Park but I don't I wouldn't want to give them a head start to test that theory so I'd go strong as we possibly can one name for me to be them before full 11th you John who plays in goal also know Martinez Martinez yeah like life yeah like I'd go as strong as possible okay because it was taught that emery likes to use his second keeper throughout every competition game for this to be rotation Olsen's game is coming up on Wednesday but like you I think he will I also to be honest but if you ask me who I would play I'd play my team so John I predicted 11 any turns what you think emery will do how does he approach this game Wednesday as I say I think you play strong but I'm with Matt and you I think I think Olsen will play and then I can think you probably expect quite similar team actually to what start against who do we play Everton yeah cash I think will play Luke Dean's difficult one because a lot of reports are saying that he's closer green to join nice online which is interesting because I spoke to people close to him at the end of last month and he was fully concentrated on continuing with Villa we had absolutely no start to leave the club and wanted to continue to fight for his place so that that's kind of caught me a bit by surprise to be honest from the midfield to the attack maybe Taylor went to play instead of Douglas Louise something like that but I think you're playing a strong team there whatever because you just want to get a lead as Matt said you can't mess around mess about in these rounds Carlos I'd expect would come in it may be instead of edge reconser and I think Torres will continue to play I think Torres is so important to how the play so build up especially against a team like Hibsbury Villa are expected to have the majority of the ball as they did against Everton and just a word on Torres I know defensively he needs to improve but I do think the one he does have the ball is always looking to progress it and he plays such an important role in terms of how Villa compose but they're not just keeping the ball for the sake of it he's always trying to move on and push it into Louise Taylor man's Kamara those players who you know a couple of one two is here and there and Villa are through into the third so I think is really important but I think just as strong as you can make it really with a couple of additions of maybe Taylorman's Carlos maybe Olsen will play but I think you'd expect a strong team that team should still be capable enough of going to Hibsbury and getting something to at least take into the second leg I'm not like I said for Everton I'm not expecting to play Hibsbury and as much as I'm saying yeah we're one of the favourites and I think we'll get it through to the proper group stage round I don't just going to Hibsbury and winning 4-0 and coming back to Villa Park and winning 6-0 or anything silly like that it could be a 2-1 up there place and a 2-0 3-0 in Villa Park and you put them to the sword at home just on Torres very quickly we spoke about him briefly yesterday and we almost came at it for what I did at least came at it from the angle of like well I didn't really notice him too much then that's good for a defender because he didn't do anything silly I'm not talking about I'm concerned about Torres or anything but I saw a graph this morning I would read it off my phone if I can put it on screen I will progressing the ball by carrying it and progressing by passes and it was the Villa Everton players I kind of just scanned through it quickly and was like oh yeah they're so and so and Pau Torres is right in the upper corner of being very good at both of them and I've watched a bit more of the game back this morning and yeah what he does on the ball is vastly important to us and and we'll be going going forward if Dean does go until Moreno comes back or Torres just shift over do you think and Carlos and Conch will become the two in the centre half yeah I would have thought so but then you you've got that left side I'm not particularly keen on that because you're asking Torres to play almost as a left back and then who's defending on the left side when he tucks around to play as a centre back it's quite like hard to think about but I'm personally not keen on it and I'm not sure we'll see too much of that this season anyway because when Moreno is fit he'll play most games I think obviously Villa want to bring in that left back don't they that probably won't happen in time for the Wednesday game so I'm not too sure maybe Lucas then will just continue to play and if he leaves then he'll leave when Villa are happy for him to leave the Dean on loan things interesting I know he's on high wages and needs we're paying some of that but French clubs aren't loaded with money so they're not gonna be taking I'll be surprised if they're taking a hundred percent of his wage I thought he was gonna leave on a permanent and Villa will get a bit of a transfer fee and the wages off the books and that was the reason why I don't think Dean is the answer going forward for Villa long term he did play well against Everton but Everton were crap so I think there's a little bit of a caveat for that just very quickly Max I know you've got a log off at midday is the squad this season given the injuries that we've had to Bwendira and Mings possibly Dean leaving Moreno and Ramsey out at the moment Coutinho possibly injured for however long Cameron Archer going who we expected might be around the squad is the squad better than last year I think it's better whether we've got enough options I don't know what I think the quality the the level of quality of the of the players has improved I because we I think the recruitment so far from what I've seen which has been very limited but as looks shrewd and because most of that squad have already had six months of working with a master so I think this squad's better than certainly in terms of quality my concern which what I alluded to earlier was where are we going for depth now now that we've got these couple of injuries because previously we'd have had two right backs in my cash and Ashley Young and actually even could have covered you at left back at the moment haven't really got that cover we haven't we haven't covering the full back areas really I suppose is my my main concern and do we have covering the central attacking attacking areas what John says if archer goes probably we left light there so I think we're better but I just think with the glut of games coming up I still feel we're quite vulnerable yeah I think that's one you're gonna have to ask after the window closes you'd expect quite a lot to happen in the last week or so but it's going in the right direction in terms of the quite the players that we have recruited as masses there that you know top quality and under Emory I think in every transfer window that we have under him coming up the only place that will be bringing will be players are exciting in place that can take forward just a couple of last things I want to talk about away from the football really many shout outs yesterday Matt we've got their light because I watched the watch the game I mean how's Owen and I got there about five to two and then my son could course he wanted his burger that was more important than getting in for kickoff so I don't know how often either of you've been in Trinity upper but the stairs are an absolute oh they are yeah so we got in the lift I'll get to the point in a minute but we got in the lift and then two guys tried to get in late and it meant that the weight limit was um was up so basically my son and his mate got out although there's no weight on them anyway and they ran up the stairs but there's a fella fella in the lift who was a big fan of the show I didn't I was in too much of a rush to get his name so that was nice but that's about it mate how about you yeah I had a few no names specifically I had a few on the way out of the stadium coming up top shot man so I keep up the good work there's one that specifically said I loved hearing John's food Doris from the US tell that to eat a little bit better in the future this is a mad thing for somebody to come up to you in sign person like a look out for John's like target spin-off episode for me each week I've had a few fans on Q&A's and stuff saying no how much they like the podcast so John in Northampton thanks for the support and also a little story bit of a stranger one but Henry weird one my partner's dad cleans his windows and they were talking chatting about villa and long story short he watches the podcast so yeah thanks Henry and Pauline it's a small world isn't it sometimes and lastly I just wanted to mention have you had your obviously you're not a season ticket holder any any more John have you had your season ticket pack Matt yeah I can't get it but I'm scared that I've got my shorts on at the moment we didn't prepare this I'm glad you've got it there with you it's very nice isn't it yeah nice little little bonus thing that Villa have sent later than the season to you I do find it funny how it's like yeah the round badge is only on the shirt it's also on everything else on the box it's on the season ticket it's on the notepad and the pen and it all sorts you get a little notepad I've just shown you these John in case you haven't seen him and a pen anything I'm ready by the way the key rings I do like a key ring the temporary round badge that won't be here for long I'm a big fan of the little kind of shopping trolley yeah what I was gonna say very quickly is obviously the talk about the round badge only being on the shirts and we'll review over the course of the year and whatnot it's been on it's been online on a couple of things well at the videos and whatnot I'd be amazed if this wasn't the badge going forward just the lion she's starting to flash up in a few places almost like to see how that goes down so I'll be surprised if that wasn't the badge going forward I've got no use for a notepad and a pen so if anyone wants to get involved in the comments if there's you're not a season ticket holder and you've maybe got little kids maybe you would like it leave us a comment and I'll send out Jax I don't write anything down these days my handwriting is terrible there might be a kid who's about to go to school as a big villa fan and would like a little villa notepad for for school or whatever so let me know in the comments and I'll send one out John Matt thanks for joining me on the second edition of the Monday show every single week we'll be here to talk about the extra talking points around the latest villain match and look ahead to the week and then injury news and whatnot next up is the burning game on Wednesday evening where there'll be a post-match show and then there should be a pressure shot the John later in the week for the burly game did we know when that is yet yeah presumably Friday won't be Thursday
